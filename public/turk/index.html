<!-- If you do not know (or care to know) about Amazon Mechanical
Turk, you can delete this directory.  For those that want to collect
audio cheaply via the crowd-sourcing, this is a relatively easy
method.  Just use the "Edit HTML" portion of AMT's web-interface and
copy the code between the lines into the HIT and change the
"recordHIT.js" to the full path of where you are hosting it.
